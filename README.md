# NYC_CitiBike_Analysis

## Background
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.


- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

The shift in color represents the amount bikes that were rented this was further broken down by time and by looking at the graph, 7-8 and 5-6 were the highest rating times where bikes where being rented.


## Summary 
Visualisation of data is one of the most important elements when creating a data story, using Tableau is a powerful tool able to create a comprehensive and organized story of the data with a wide range of different tool sets. This project specifically reminded me of a data visualist who uses Blender to create 3D and interactive models and animations. I think incorporating a level of geo-node capability would enhance geographical maps and create the ability to visulize and track common/ popular paths taken in this study.
